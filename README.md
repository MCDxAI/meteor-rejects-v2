## Rejects² (Inactive)

# The official [Meteor Rejects](https://github.com/AntiCope/meteor-rejects) has updated to 1.21.11

Rejects v2 was built primarily to test [minecraft-dev-mcp](https://github.com/MCDxAI/minecraft-dev-mcp) , and for the growing number meteor client users asking for it to be updated
<p>
Now that the official Meteor Rejects addon is updated, this repo will remain archived unless another developer wants to take over, as it no longer serves a purpose
